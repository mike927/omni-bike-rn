## Project Context

Omni Bike is an iOS indoor cycling companion app. It connects to a BLE stationary bike and optional HR sources, records training sessions, and syncs completed workouts to Strava.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Expo SDK 54 (New Architecture enforced) + `expo-router`
- **State**: `zustand`
- **Database**: `expo-sqlite` + `drizzle-orm`
- **BLE**: `react-native-ble-plx`
- **iOS Native**: `react-native-activity-kit` (Live Activities), `react-native-health`

### Key Constraints

- **HR source priority**: Watch HR > BLE chest strap HR > Bike-reported pulse. Resolved at merge time in the MetronomeEngine, not in the UI.
- **1 Hz tick model**: The MetronomeEngine samples all sources at 1 Hz. Higher resolution is unnecessary for the metrics displayed.
- **Gear persistence before DB**: Saved devices use lightweight key-value storage. The full SQLite schema is introduced only when session recording needs it.
- **Offline-first**: All session data persists locally. Network failures never block the training flow. Uploads happen post-workout and can be retried.

## Native iOS Constraints

Do not run `expo prebuild --clean` after the watchOS companion app target has been added to `ios/`. The `--clean` flag wipes the entire `ios/` directory and destroys the Watch target. Use `expo prebuild` (without `--clean`) for incremental config changes. If `--clean` was accidentally run, restore `ios/OmniBikeWatch/` and the Watch target from git.

- The `ios/` directory is intentionally committed to git (partial eject — watchOS companion app target).
- The Watch target (`OmniBikeWatch`) and its three Swift files live in `ios/OmniBikeWatch/` and are managed manually in Xcode.
- The config plugin `plugins/with-watch-extension.js` only adds entitlements and Info.plist keys — it is safe to re-apply at every prebuild run.

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is enforced. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` are on.
- Never use `as any`. Use the actual schema or type returned by a given service.
- Use `type` imports for type-only values. Enforced by ESLint (`consistent-type-imports`).
- Prefer `interface` for contracts and public API shapes. Use `type` for unions, intersections, and utility types.
- Interfaces and type aliases use `PascalCase`. Enum members use `UPPER_CASE` or `PascalCase`.
- Do not declare reusable interfaces or type aliases inside implementation files such as adapters, hooks, screens, or components. Put them in a dedicated sibling file, contract file, or `src/types/` module and import them where needed.
- Do not use magic values (inline UUIDs, URLs, numeric constants). Define named constants at module scope. If the same value is needed in multiple files, define it once and import it.

### Architecture

- Use the adapter pattern for external integrations. Define a contract interface (e.g., `BikeAdapter`, `HrAdapter`) and implement it per device or provider.
- Feature logic lives in `src/features/<domain>/`. Service and transport logic lives in `src/services/<domain>/`.
- Hooks are the public API of a feature. They live in `src/features/<domain>/hooks/`.
- Parsers are pure functions that live in `src/services/<domain>/parsers/`.
- Keep layers directional: features → services → parsers. Never import upward.

### Testing

- Use Jest. Test files live in `__tests__/` directories next to the source they test.
- Name test files `<Module>.test.ts`.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., `bleClient`) at the module level using `jest.mock()`.
- Use `describe` blocks per method or behavior. Use `it` for individual cases.

### Style

- Use tagged logging: `console.error('[ClassName] message')`.
- Use `unknown` for caught errors, not `any`. Narrow with `instanceof Error`.
- Prefer `const` and `prefer-const` is enforced.
- Prettier is integrated via ESLint (120 char width, single quotes, trailing commas).
